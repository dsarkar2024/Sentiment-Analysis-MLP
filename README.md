# Sentiment-Analysis-MLP
This project is done as a part of my coursework CS-584. 
Here I developed an MLP model. Trained the model using MNIST dataset. Tested its accuracy on test data. 
Then I created an MLP model with convolution layers. Trained the model using the same dataset and checked the accuracy of the model on testing data.
Found out that MLP with convolution layer has a better accuracy.
